# blog.sh

`blog.sh` is a minimal blog engine in a small shell script. Features:

* Requires only a posix shell, a markdown processor and git
* Handle both blog posts and normal pages
* No boilerplate, just create a markdown file
* Show creation and update timestamps (taken from git history)

# karl.berlin

The repo also contains the content for my personal blog and homepage (http://www.karl.berlin). If this is a problem for anyone who wants to use `blog.sh`, please let me know and I will split the repos. For now, this is more convenient for me.
