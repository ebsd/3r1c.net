# About

My name is eric. 

I like simplicity and liked 1990s internet. That's why i own a very light website with a minimum of technology. Welcome to the small web !

The technology is fabulous but it seems we have exceeded the prescribed dose. Tech has become addictive: more tech = more addiction, more addiction = more tech. Wouldn't this be what we called digital transformation? How far will we go? The madness of centralized social networks is already impacting real society. Shouldn't we ask ourselves how far we want to go? Meanwhile, I think the internet in the 1990s was great. So welcome to the small web!

This is a static website, with just a little of css.
