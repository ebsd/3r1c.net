# How to Hire Me

I currently have a stable job that pays reasonably well for my locale. If youâ€™re looking to hire, please provide the following information so that I can make an informed decision and do further research to learn about your company.

- the name of the company offering the job
- salary and benefits on offer
- required skills
- optional skills
- presence and travel requirements
- citizenship, visa, and clearance requirements
- why the position is open

Please do not send me contract-to-hire jobs, send email to my work accounts, or address me as "Matt". Such familiarity toward a stranger is unprofessional and unwelcome.
